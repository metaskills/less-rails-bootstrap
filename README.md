# Less Rails Bootstrap [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/metaskills/less-rails-bootstrap.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/metaskills/less-rails-bootstrap)

Bootstrap is Twitter's toolkit for kickstarting your site or app's CSS. It includes base styles for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grid layout, navigation, alerts, and more. To get started -- check out the [Bootstrap docs](http://getbootstrap.com/).

The less-rails-bootstrap project hooks into [less-rails](http://github.com/metaskills/less-rails) and [less.rb](http://github.com/cowboyd/less.rb), making Bootstrap's source LESS files, compiled CSS, and JavaScript files available in the Rails 4.x and 5.x asset pipeline.

The benefits:

* Assets are namespaced in twitter/bootstrap to avoid asset conflicts.
* Top level requires to get all stylesheets or javascripts.
* Ability to import or require individually namespaced stylesheets or javascripts.


## Installation

LESS requires a JavaScript runtime to work. Which one you use depends on your Ruby implementation. Two are shown for Ruby (MRI) and JRuby. Add only the relevant one to your Gemfile. If you want to use Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins, also add the `jquery-rails` gem. Finally, add `less-rails-bootstrap` and run `bundle install`.

```ruby
# Gemfile

gem 'therubyracer'  # If using Ruby
gem 'therubyrhino'  # If using JRuby
gem 'jquery-rails'  # If using Bootstrap's JS plugins.
gem 'less-rails-bootstrap'
```

## Basic CSS Use

### Simple way

Get the full Bootstrap stylesheet with a single line in your `application.css`.

```
/*
 *= require twitter/bootstrap
 */
```    

### Advanced way

In case when you just want to modify several LESS variables (i.e. change text color, etc.) and don't want to thinking about [Full Control & Customization](https://github.com/metaskills/less-rails-bootstrap-test#full-control--customization) you can run Rails generator:

```
rails generate less_rails_bootstrap:custom_bootstrap
```

It generates three files:

* `app/assets/stylesheets/custom_bootstrap/custom_bootstrap.less` - auto-generated file base on bootstrap.less file from original Twitter Bootstrap. Don't modify it!
* `app/assets/stylesheets/custom_bootstrap/variables.less` - in this file you can override Twitter Bootstrap variables or define own
* `app/assets/stylesheets/custom_bootstrap/mixins.less` - in this file you can override Twitter Bootstrap mixins or define own

Then just add single line to `application.css`.

```
/*
 *= require custom_bootstrap/custom_bootstrap
 */
```

> Please see the [less-rails-bootstrap-test](http://github.com/metaskills/less-rails-bootstrap-test) repo for examples that customize the CSS output by using LESS. The "CSS Tests Suites" section of the README and code is what you want to focus on. Also, check out the [LESS syntax](http://lesscss.org/). 

## Basic JavaScript Use

In `application.js`, require jQuery first. Now you can add all the Bootstrap plugins with a single line.

````
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require twitter/bootstrap
````

Or include plugins individually.

````
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require twitter/bootstrap/modal
//= require twitter/bootstrap/alert
````


## Versioning

This gem will directly track the semantic versioning of the Twitter Bootstrap project. Our major and minor versions will always match to theirs, though we may have tiny patch level releases specific to this gem.


## Contributing

This gem is fully tested from Rails 4.0 to 5.2. We run our tests on [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/metaskills/less-rails-boostrap) in both Ruby 1.9, 2.0  and jRuby 9000. If you detect a problem, open up a github issue or fork the repo and help out. After you fork or clone the repository, the following commands will get you up and running on the test suite.

```shell
$ bundle
$ bundle exec appraisal install
$ bundle exec appraisal test
```

We use the [appraisal](https://github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal) gem from Thoughtbot to help us generate the individual gemfiles for each Rails version and to run the tests locally against each generated Gemfile. The `appraisal test` command actually runs our test suite against all Rails versions in our `Appraisal` file. If you want to run the tests for a specific Rails version, use `rake -T` for a list. For example, the following command will run the tests for Rails 4.0 only.

```shell
$ bundle exec appraisal rails40 rake test
```
